Reset:This is a retro 2D game designed for a software engineering module at Swansea University. You're in control of a player in a maze like structure where the aim of the game is to reach the treasure in the maze and advance to the next level. To do this you'll need to pass obstacles like doors, water and lava along the way whilst avoiding enemies that have been plotted throughout the maze. Upon completing a level you will be given the time you took to complete the level and an option to share that to Twitter.
