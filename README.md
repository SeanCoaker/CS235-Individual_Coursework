# CS235-Individual_Coursework

For this coursework within the CS235 module at Swansea University, I was individually tasked with performing a round of user research, analysing feedback and implementing new features on a previously developed retro video game system. Due to COVID-19, I was limited to only being able to conduct user research with a couple of participants. Despite this, I was still able to gain experience in developing user research plans and documentation.

As part of the user research procedure, I needed to identify new features that should be added to the retro video game prototype, with these features then being added to the existing system. For this, I advanced both the front end and the back end of the retro video game including the development of a tweet score features and the re-designing of the user interface to better match the feel of the characters and items included within the game. Development of these features were once again carried out in Java and JavaFX.
